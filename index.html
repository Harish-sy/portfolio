    <h3 >Speed Breaker Detection and Warning System</h3>
    <p>There is evidence to support the claim that speed breakers can cause accidents and injury. Where a vehicle approaches a speed breaker at a speed greater than threshold velocity , the risk of accident or injury is substantial. Speed breakers are inconspicuous in low visibility condition, like at night, or where there is fog, rain or snow. This problem is acute in development countries where speed breakers don’t always accompany warning signs. We propose an early warning system that uses sensor based technology to alert the driver in advance when the vehicle is approaching the speed breaker.</p>
